### Purpose:
- Notify health insurance company of accident involvement

### Process:

    content: `## üí∞ What is a Lien

**What is a lien?**

- **LIEN** refers to a legal claim or legal right which is made against the assets that are held as collaterals for satisfying a debt
- A medical lien is any demand for repayment for medical services that can be placed against the settlement money paid out in a personal injury case

### Health Insurance Company's Position:
The health insurance company's stance is that if someone else is at fault for your injuries and you receive compensation from that negligent party, they, as your health insurer, should be reimbursed for the portion of the medical expenses they covered originally.

### Impact:
- **Reduces settlement amount** available to client
- **Requires negotiation** with medical providers
- **Must be resolved** before final disbursement
- **Affects client recovery** significantly

### Liens Providers:
- Doctors specialized in personal injury
- Already affiliated with the firm

### Key Considerations:
- Liens must be identified early in case process
- Negotiation may be required to reduce lien amounts
- Liens affect final client recovery amount`,

    content: `## üîÑ What is Subrogation

**What is subrogation?**

Subrogation is when the client's health insurance company seeks reimbursement for the payment they made on behalf of the client's medical expenses incurred by hospitals, doctors, and therapists.

### Process:
If our client got treatment through an Ambulance, in an emergency room, urgent care or through his primary care physician, the health insurance pays for the charges.

### Key Concepts:
- **Insurance Payment** - Health insurance pays for medical expenses
- **Reimbursement** - Insurance company seeks repayment from settlement

- **Treatment Types** - Ambulance, emergency room, urgent care, primary care

### Common Scenarios:

- **Ambulance Services** - Transportation costs covered
- **Urgent Care** - Immediate medical attention
- **Primary Care** - Ongoing medical treatment

### Impact on Cases:
- **Lien Creation** - Insurance company creates lien against settlement
- **Settlement Reduction** - Lien amount reduces client's recovery
- **Negotiation Required** - May need to negotiate lien amounts

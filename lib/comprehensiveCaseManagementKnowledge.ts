### 3. Health Insurance
Covers the whole or a part of the risk of a person incurring medical expenses, spreading the risk over many persons.

**What are the different types of insurance claims?**

### 1. Motor Vehicle Claims
- **Bodily Injury Claim** - Car insurance companies provide bodily injury liability car insurance in order to provide drivers with compensation for injuries they sustain in an accident. It's important to note that your liability insurance pays for the other driver's injuries when you are at fault.
- **Property Damage Claim** - Property damage liability insurance covers the cost of damages to someone else's property after an accident you cause. Most commonly, your property damage will pay out when you are at fault for an accident that causes damage to someone else's car.

### 2. Premises Liability Claims
Holds property owners and residents liable for accidents and injuries that occur on that property. The kinds of incidents that may result in premises liability claims can range from a slip and fall on a public sidewalk to an injury suffered on an amusement park ride.

### 3. Government Claims
If the case involves a county, city or other local governmental entity or employee, the claim should be filed directly with the local city or county's governing board.

### Coverage Terminologies:

1. **Bodily Injury Liability/Policy Limits (PL)** - If you are responsible for a car accident, bodily injury liability coverage pays for the medical costs of the people who are injured (not including yourself).

2. **Uninsured Motorist (UM)** - A coverage that helps you pay for damages caused by a driver who doesn't have car insurance.

3. **Underinsured Motorist (UIM)** - A coverage that protects you if you're hit by a driver who doesn't have enough coverage to pay for the damages or injuries they caused.

4. **Medical Payments (MedPay)** - An additional coverage option for auto insurance policies in most states. In the event of a car accident, this coverage can help pay for medical expenses for you or your passengers, even if you're at fault.

5. **Collision** - A coverage that helps pay to repair or replace your vehicle if it's damaged or destroyed in an accident with another car, regardless of who is at fault.

6. **Comprehensive** - Covers any damage to a car except for damage from a collision.

**What is personal injury law?**

Personal injury is an area of law that protects individuals from injury that results from another person or party's negligence, malpractice, or any act of wrong doing. When an accident happens, victims don't immediately settle with the liable party. They look for an attorney to help them get better compensation for injuries, both mental and physical.

### Key Concepts:
- **Protection for injured individuals** from negligent parties
- **Compensation for injuries** - both mental and physical
- **Legal representation** to maximize recovery
- **Negligence-based claims** against responsible parties`,
